[YouTube Tutorial](https://youtu.be/uk9pviyvrtg) for this repository.

Add your API Keys to the .env file you will find on Glitch after launching this code by using the button above.

Modify the code in your Glitch project to add your own custom API endpoints.

You can host this NodeJS project elsewhere, but Glitch makes it easy.

Never include your .env file in a GitHub repository. Add _.env_ to your _.gitignore_ file before pushing a project to GitHub.
